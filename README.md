# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Simple Forms with useForm and Formik

This repository demonstrates the implementation of two simple forms in a React application. One form is built using react-hook-form (useForm), and the other uses Formik. This project provides a side-by-side comparison of these two popular libraries for form handling in React.

## Features

useForm: A lightweight library for managing forms in React with minimal re-renders.

Formik: A robust library for handling forms with built-in support for validation and state management.

Example usage of validation for both forms.

Minimal styling to keep the focus on functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-forms.git
